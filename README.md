Arduino code on our Sumobot. Placed first in the McMaster University Sumobots competition.

Hardware specs:

* 2 motors mounted in the rear , on tracks.
* 2 sonar sensors mounted in the front, (left and right).
* 4 QTI sensors or QRDS (doesn't matter) mounted on each corner of the robot (square pattern).
* 1 IR sensor in front of the Sumobot, in between the sonar sensors.
* actually body doesn't matter.


Making the code work with your own bot?

All you need to do is make sure that the proper pins are hooked up to your Arduino, please refer to the top of the code, "timmy.ino"
